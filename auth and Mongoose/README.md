Create a link aggregator site (like reddit, hacker news, etc.) that supports user registration and loginâ€¦ along with the ability to post articles (links).

Registering or logging in will create an authenticated session that contains all of the logged in user's information. Some elements on pages will only appear when a user is logged in. Some pages will redirect to login if a user arrives unauthenticated.
